=head1 NAME

Bot::Backbone::Service::ConsoleChat - Chat with an interactive command line

=head1 VERSION

version 0.142220

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  service console => (
      service  => 'ConsoleChat',
  );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a handy service for interacting with a bot from the command line. This
can be useful for interfering with the state of the bot or working with the bot
without going through some other chat server.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 term

This is the internal readline terminal object.

No user serviceable parts.

=head2 prompt

This is the prompt displayed to the user. It is "> " by default. You may set
this during initialization or the bot may modify it as desired.

=head2 username

This is the name of the user at the console. This is set to C<$ENV{USER}> by
default.

=head2 nickname

This is the nickname to give the user at the console. As of now, this is also se to
C<$ENV{USER}> be default.

It may be set to gecos or something by default in the future.`

=head1 EVENT HANDLERS

=head2 _start

Starts the chat and shows the first prompt.

=head2 got_console_input

Whenever the user hits enter, this dispatches, notifies the chat consumers, and
puts up the next prompt.

Anything not matching a built-in command will be passed to the bot as a direct
message.  
The built-in commands include:

=head3 /quit

This causes the bot to shutdown and exit.

=head2 cli_message

Handles most messages typed on the command line.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 initialize

This sets up the L<POE::Session> that is used to manage the terminal wheel.

=head2 send_message

Whenever the bot sends a message, it will be displayed if it is a direct message
back to the console or if the group name matches the L</current_group>. All
other messages will be muted.

=head2 shutdown

Says good-bye and destroys the terminal object, which will shutdown the session
and allow the bot to exit.
