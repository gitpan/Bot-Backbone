=head1 NAME

Bot::Backbone::SendPolicy::Aggregate - Pull several send policies together

=head1 VERSION

version 0.140280

=head1 DESCRIPTION

You probably don't need to worry about this policy directly. Simply by defining a policy using the C<send_policy> helper loaded by L<Bot::Backbone>, you will end up using this to mix them together.

Basically, this just provides tools for configuring multiple policies and makes sure that the most restrictive policies win.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 config

This is the send policy configuration to use.

=head2 policies

This is the list of L<Bot::Backbone::SendPolicy> objects to apply. These are built automatically based upon L</config>.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 allow_send

Applies all the L</policies> to the message and returns the most restrictive send policy results.

This does perform short circuiting
